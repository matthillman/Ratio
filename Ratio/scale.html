        <p>Measuring by weight, rather than by volume, is the most accurate, easiest and cleanest way to measure.  Measuring by weight is what allows ratios to work.  In order to measure by weight, you need a digital scale which are widely available and affordable.  The kind of scale you use doesn’t matter so long as it can measure in ounces and grams, has a “tare,” or zeroing, button, and has a range of .25 ounces to around 5 pounds, or 1 gram up to 2.5 kilos.</p>
        <p>Why is weighing more accurate.  A cup of flour can weigh anywhere between four and six ounces.  This means if you are making a recipe calling for four cups of flour you might wind up with a pound of flour in your bowl or you might end up with a pound and a half.  That’s a fifty percent difference in the main ingredient which will have a substantial impact on the finished product.  But 20 ounces is 20 ounces.  Using parts by weight in these ratios also ensures that it doesn’t matter what kind of measurements you use, Imperial or metric—five parts flour and 3 parts liquid can be measured either way.</p>
        <p>Using a scale also simplifies your life.  You can measure ingredients right into your bowl.  To take the bread example, you might simply put your mixing bowl on the scale, pour in flour until you have 20 ounces, then pour in 12 ounces of water.  If you’re using solid fat such as shortening for a pie dough, using a scale is much cleaner.  I’ve always been annoyed by recipes that call for a cup of shortening.  So much easier to set your mixing bowl on the scale and spoon in 8 ounces (which will be a little more than a cup in volume) with your twelve ounces of flour.</p>
        <p>If you don’t have a scale, you can still use ratios but they’re less consistent. If you don’t have a scale, figure that one cup of flour weights 5 ounces, that large eggs weigh two ounces, and use Morton’s coarse kosher salt, which has an even volume to weight ratio.</p>
        
        <p>Notes about the fundamental ingredients:
        <ul>
            <li>“Flour” means all-purpose flour unless otherwise noted.</li>
            <li>“Salt” means coarse kosher salt (I use Morton’s kosher salt, which has a close volume-to-weight ratio; that is, a tablespoon equals ½ ounce).</li>
            <li>“Eggs” mean large eggs.</li>
            <li>“Butter” can mean salted or sweet, whichever is your preference, unless noted in the recipe.  Most chefs prefer to use sweet because it has a purer flavor and it allows them to better control the salt level of their food.  I prefer the flavor of salted butter in most, not all, preparations; it’s what I’m used to in terms of seasoning food.  Regardless of your butter preference, you should always season to taste.  When butter is a predominant component of a ratio, as with the 1-2-3 cookie ratio, it should go without saying that the better the butter, the better the cookie.</li>
        </ul>
