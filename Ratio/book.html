        <h3>Ratios are the starting point from which a thousand variations begin.</h3>
        
        <p>A culinary ratio is simply a proportion of one ingredient relative to another. A custard is 2 parts liquid, 1 part egg.  Pasta dough is 3 parts flour, 2 parts egg.  Bread is 5 parts flour, 3 parts water.  When you know a culinary ratio, it’s not like knowing a single recipe, it’s like knowing a thousand.</p>
        
        <p>This, the <em>Ratio</em> iPhone application, based on the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d.html/ref=mp_s_a_1?a=1416566112&sr=8-1"><em>Ratio: The Simple Codes Behind the Craft of Everyday Cooking</em></a>, puts 28 key ratios in your pocket, a tap away. The app does all the calculating and converting for you.  Just enter the amount of one ingredient, and all the ingredients will appear in their exact proportions.</p>
        
        <p>This application is your electronic guide to the fundamental preparations that form the backbone of the culinary arts: breads and pastas, cakes and cookies, sausages, brines, stock, sauces, soups, custards both savory and sweet, the sweet sauces, and a resource for keeping track of your experiences with them.</p>
        
        <p>Ratios are proportions by weight, not by volume, so they work best in conjunction with a scale. (<a href="http://ruhlman.theopenskyproject.com/eatsmart-precision-pro-scale.html">Here’s the scale I use</a>.)  We help you fudge it here if you don’t have one, but the only surefire way ratios work, and work every time, is if you weigh your ingredients.</p>
        
        <p>There is no beginner who can’t take Superman-sized leaps and bounds when he or she embraces a ratio. There is no chef, not even the best chef on earth, who can’t get a little better by bringing a culinary fundamental closer to that unreachable state of perfection.  A ratio is the starting point.</p>
